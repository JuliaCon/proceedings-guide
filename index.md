# Proceedings guide

The JuliaCon proceedings are meant as a complement to a presentation of
any format (mini-symposium, talk, lightning talk, poster)
accepted for the conference. They provide readers with
references, more detailed explanations and structure required to
understand the subject of the presentation in more depth.
All submissions are reviewed with a very similar process as the [Journal of Open-Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org), that is we follow the same [guiding principles](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html) and use the [`@whedon` GitHub bot](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whedon.html). However, we accept different kinds of contributions and use a different paper template.

For more information, checkout the [Author's guide](author), if you want to submit a paper, and the [Reviewer's guide](reviewer) if you are supporting us as a voluntary reviewer.
