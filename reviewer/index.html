See the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/page/authors/conflict-of-interest">PNAS guidelines</a> for a definition and examples. Conflicts of interest include any work or authors with which the reviewer has &quot;any association that poses or could be perceived as a financial or intellectual conflict of interest&quot; &#40;PNAS guidelines above&#41;.</p> <h2 id=code_of_conduct ><a href="#code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a></h2> <p>The reviewer commits to reading and respecting the conference <a href="https://juliacon.org/2019/coc">Code of Conduct</a> in the assessment and all communications during the review process.</p> <p>If some content submitted to the Conference does not comply with the Code of Conduct, the reviewer should refer it to the organizing committee.</p> <h2 id=submitted_documents ><a href="#submitted_documents">Submitted documents</a></h2> <p>Submitted work comes in two types: extended abstracts and full papers. See the author guide for more information on both.</p> <h2 id=review_comments ><a href="#review_comments">Review comments</a></h2> <p>Each review should include a general recommendation from the following list:</p> <ul> <li><p>Accept as-is: no modification required on the document</p> <li><p>Minor modification request: some changes are required but are minor enough to be done in one round, they do not affect the core content of the paper.</p> <li><p>Major modification request: some changes are requested on some central aspects of the paper and will need to be checked in an additional round of review.</p> </ul> <p>In any case other than an acceptation as-is, the reviewer should provide the author with a list of comments they can use to improve their document for the next round, citing the corresponding parts of the documents, they should in all comments be as specific as possible.</p> <h2 id=review_process ><a href="#review_process">Review process</a></h2> <p>The review process is similar to the <a href="http://joss.theoj.org">Journal of Open-Source Software</a> and takes place in a dedicated GitHub issue. A reviewer checklist is generated for each reviewer of the paper. A box should be checked only once the reviewer considers that the criterion is met by the work presented.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: the checklist is meant as a general guide for reviewers and does not capture subject-specific best practices or notation consistency. The reviewer should feel free to indicate what they consider should be edited in the submitted work.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; JuliaCon Team.
